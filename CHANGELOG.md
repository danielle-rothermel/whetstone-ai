# Changelog

All notable changes to `whetstone-ai` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The effect-authority and tool-admission SQL backends now verify their
  owned SQLite and PostgreSQL tables through the shared
  `dr_store.relational` primitives instead of duplicating column and
  constraint introspection, the transaction observer protocol, and the
  persisted-type guards in each tree. No schema, table, version, or
  wire-format change.
- `EffectAuthoritySchemaMismatchError` now carries structured `table`,
  `aspect`, `expected`, and `actual` fields, matching
  `ToolAdmissionSchemaMismatchError`. It remains an
  `EffectAuthorityError` subclass.

### Removed

- Unused `whetstone.coordination.official` certification package (official
  evaluation records, evaluation authority, aggregation, mapping, selection,
  and store); nothing consumed it.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-08-21

### Added

- First published release of the evaluation and optimization toolkit:
  experiment contract, batched evaluation engine, COPRO-wired optimizer
  harness, and platform pipeline extras.
- `register_runtime` accepts a caller `Experiment` and proposer transport so
  non-toy consumers can replace the default toy experiment and dummy transport.
- `RunRequest` lives on `HarnessRunController` so in-process consumers can
  import it without the optional DBOS extra.
